      and recognition. Some fight for the thrill, others for revenge, and some for
      the hope of catching the eye of the Grandmaster.

      power beyond imagination. It's said that those who impress the Grandmaster
      are granted a wish, anything their heart desires.
    Character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b2efda9f53f6d2444a0d7b83a78b3d88, type: 2}

      the opponents are relentless. You must be prepared for anything. And then there
      are the alliances and rivalries. Choose your friends and enemies wisely.

  - Line: Stay alert. Learn from every fight, whether you win or lose. And remember,
      strength isn't just about muscle. Strategy and cunning often win where brute
      force fails. Also, find a mentor. There are those here who can teach you, if
      you're willing to learn.

      one's true character. Make sure you're ready.
